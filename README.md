# 💰 HalloApp - A Blockchain-Based Savings Account with Transaction History

A simple **decentralized savings application** built with **Solidity** and deployed on the **Celo Blockchain (Sepolia Testnet)**.  
This project demonstrates how blockchain can enable **transparent, self-custodied, and tamper-proof personal savings** with a full transaction history.

## 📜 Project Description

**HalloApp** allows users to **deposit**, **withdraw**, and **track** their Ether savings directly on the blockchain.  
Every transaction (deposit or withdrawal) is stored permanently on-chain with a **timestamp** — ensuring complete transparency and security.

This project is designed for **beginners learning Solidity and blockchain app development** using the **Celo network** or **EVM-compatible blockchains**.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Users can deposit Ether into their personal on-chain savings account.  
- Users can withdraw funds anytime (subject to available balance).  
- The contract automatically records all transactions — both deposits and withdrawals.  
- Each user’s balance and history are stored separately.  
- The contract is fully transparent — all activity is verifiable on-chain.
